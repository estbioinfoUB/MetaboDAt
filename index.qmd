# Overview

Using high-throughput technologies, life science researchers can identify and characterize all the small molecules or metabolites in a given cell, tissue, or organism.

This non-profit course covers a wide range of topics ranging from understanding metabolomics technologies, data collection and analysis, using pathway databases, performing pathway analysis, conducting univariate and multivariate statistics, working with metabolomic databases, and exploring chemical databases.

Hands-on practical tutorials using various data sets and tools will assist participants in learning metabolomics analysis techniques.

# Organizers

The course is organized by the [Faculty of Biology](https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/biology) and [Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences](https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/farmacia-en/home) of the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/inici), [The Metabolics Innovation Center (TMIC)](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwi-6tn72OmFAxVPLgYAHa99DoEYABABGgJ3cw&ase=2&gclid=CjwKCAjwrcKxBhBMEiwAIVF8rK6JO-mrj7NxWThYrKdhvusBDT_0lYjOgAUgVZezqDd7RE2l-CsSihoCPDoQAvD_BwE&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESV-D2w5IzmDu3potOFgLxC_qaczcMUnKhMD0U72zVIvBIuiysXlmlG7R9DXzehHqRiwvnpJ4q09KbAtV6WmL_OU9asnNlD9Jlqskv2X0IxtBs6jOEFALqeQ&sig=AOD64_08iLxIFKSnrvtIZVQt1zVU08AM3Q&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwi36tD72OmFAxXX1wIHHcPgC3cQ0Qx6BAgEEAM) of the [University of Alberta]() and the [Frailty and Healthy Ageing-CIBERFES](https://www.ciberfes.es/en/about-us/welcome-from-the-scientific-director).
