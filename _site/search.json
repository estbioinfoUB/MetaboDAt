    "text": "Overview\nUsing high-throughput technologies, life science researchers can identify and characterize all the small molecules or metabolites in a given cell, tissue, or organism.\nThis non-profit course covers a wide range of topics ranging from understanding metabolomics technologies, data collection and analysis, using pathway databases, performing pathway analysis, conducting univariate and multivariate statistics, working with metabolomic databases, and exploring chemical databases.\nHands-on practical tutorials using various data sets and tools will assist participants in learning metabolomics analysis techniques.\n\n\nOrganizers\nThe course is organized by the Faculty of Biology and Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences of the University of Barcelona, The Metabolics Innovation Center (TMIC) of the University of Alberta and the Frailty and Healthy Ageing-CIBERFES.\n\nDavid Wishart, University of Alberta, Canadá\nAlex Sanchez, University of Barcelona, CIBERFES-ISCIII\nCristina Andres-Lacueva, University of Barcelona, CIBERFES-ISCIII\nXavier Nogués, IMIM-Hospital del Mar, CIBERFES-ISCIII\nPedro Abizanda, Servicio de Salud de Castilla la Mancha (SESCAM), CIBERFES-ISCIII\nAnna Guadall, University of Barcelona\nMiriam Martínez Huélamo, University of Barcelona, CIBERFES-ISCIII\n\n\n\nSpeakers\nThe course will be taught by professors:\n\nDavid Wishart (University of Alberta, Canada),\nAlex Sanchez-Pla (University of Barcelona, Spain)\nXavier Nogués (Hospital del Mar, Spain)\nCristina Andrés-Lacueva ((University of Barcelona, Spain)\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\nLearn to correctly design metabolome-focused experiments.\nUnderstand advantages and limitations of metabolomic data analysis.\nPresent bioinformatics workflows for metabolomic data.\nLearn how to select and apply Statistics and Machine learning to undertake rigorous data analysis.\nVisualize datasets to gain intuitive insights into the composition and/or activity of their metabolome\n\n\n\nContents\n\nFundamentals of metabolomics.\nTargeted metabolomics with MEGA and LC-Autofit.\nStatistics for metabolomics: From tests to projections.\nMetabolomics data analysis with MetaboAnalyst.\nMachine learning and Artificial Intelligence applied to metabolomics.\nPathway Analysis and Biological Significance.\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\nThis course is intended for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, clinical fellows and investigators who are interested in learning about both bioinformatic and cheminformatic tools to analyze and interpret metabolomics data.\n\n\nRegistration, Dates and Number of participants\n\nNumber of participants: 25\nDuration: 11th - 14th June 2024\nRegistration fee:\n\n60 Euros (+21% VAT) for academic researchers (10% discount if agreed),\n500€ (+21% VAT) for industry.\n\n\nIt only includes participation in workshop and coffee breaks. Materials will be provided online\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate registration\n\n\n\nThere are a few places left so, in case you still want to register you may try this link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerrequisites\nThe attendants are expected to be familar with at least one language such as R or Python for data analysis.\nYou will require your own laptop computer. Minimum requirements: 1024×768 screen resolution, 2.4GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB free disk space, recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X or Linux (Most computers purchased in the past 3-4 years likely meet these requirements).\nThere workshop requires participants to complete pre-workshop tasks and readings, to be available form this website soon.",
