    "text": "Overview\nUsing high-throughput technologies, life science researchers can identify and characterize all the small molecules or metabolites in a given cell, tissue, or organism.\nThis course covers a wide range of topics ranging from understanding metabolomics technologies, data collection and analysis, using pathway databases, performing pathway analysis, conducting univariate and multivariate statistics, working with metabolomic databases, and exploring chemical databases.\nHands-on practical tutorials using various data sets and tools will assist participants in learning metabolomics analysis techniques.\nThe course will be taught by professors:\n\nDavid Wishart (University of Alberta, Canada) and\nAlex Sanchez-Pla (University of Barcelona, Spain)\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\nLear to correctly design metabolome-focused experiments.\nUnderstand advantages and limitations of metabolomic data analysis.\nPresent bioinformatics workflows for metabolomic data.\nLearn how to select and apply statistics and Machine learning to undertake rigorous data analysis.\nVisualize datasets to gain intuitive insights into the composition and/or activity of their metabolome\n\n\n\nContents\n\nFundamentals of metabolomics (David Wishart)\nTargeted metabolomics with MEGA and LC-Autofit (David Wishart)\nStatistics for metabolomics: From tests to projections. (Alex Sánchez)\nMetabolomics data analysis with MetaboAnalyst (David Wishart and Alex Sanchez)\nMachine learning and Artificial Intelligence applied to metabolomics (Alex Sánchez)\nPathway Analysis and Biological Significance (Alex Sánchez)\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\nThis course is intended for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, clinical fellows and investigators who are interested in learning about both bioinformatic and cheminformatic tools to analyze and interpret metabolomics data.\n\n\nNumber of participants, dates and registration\n\nNumber of participants: 25\nDuration: 11th – 14th June 2024\nRegistration fee: 60 Euros (+21% VAT) for academic researchers (10% discount if agreed) 500€ (+21% VAT) for industry. It only includes participation in workshop and coffee breaks. Materials will be provided online\nPre-register HERE (link opens on April 24)\nSelection criteria: Participants will be selected according to their CV and motivation statement. Selected participants will be notified via email by mid May 2024.\n\n\n\nPrerrequisites\nThe attendants are expected to be familar with at least one language such as R or Python for data analysis.\nYou will require your own laptop computer. Minimum requirements: 1024×768 screen resolution, 2.4GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB free disk space, recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X or Linux (Most computers purchased in the past 3-4 years likely meet these requirements).\nThere workshop requires participants to complete pre-workshop tasks and readings, to be available form this website soon.\n\n\nVenue\nFacultat de Biologia de la Universitat de Barcelona. Classrooms available soon.",
